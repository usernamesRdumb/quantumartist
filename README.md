🧠🌀 QUANTUM ART GENERATOR
Collapse a wavefunction. Get a painting.
“People think it’s just shapes and colors.
I see Schrödinger whispering in binary.”

This isn’t art made by humans.
This isn’t art made by machines.
This is art made by the void — the raw entropy of the quantum realm — harnessed, digitized, and rendered as pixels by a handcrafted code engine that’s part aesthetic ritual, part physics experiment, part unhinged cosmic joke.

⚛️ TL;DR
Real quantum seed (via Qiskit & AerSimulator)

Falls back to random.getrandbits() if your timeline sucks

PyQt5 GUI with threaded generation (no freezing, no tears)

3 styles: original, fractal, inkblot

CLI mode for when you want to batch-hack the matrix

Full metadata dump in .json — reproducible entropy included

🧾 INSTALLATION
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install qiskit pillow PyQt5 numpy
You might also want:

bash
Copy

sudo pacman -S tinfoil-hat coffee
🖥 RUNNING IT LIKE A GOD
GUI (Default Mode)
bash
Copy
Edit
python quantum_art_generator.py
Choose your visual flavor.

Smash “Generate Quantum Art.”

Wait for quantum collapse.

Save the artifact.

Contemplate reality.

CLI (Silent Mode)
bash
Copy
Edit
python quantum_art_generator.py --cli
Outputs a .png + matching .json

Saves to temp dir or wherever the OS lets us write

Great for cron jobs, rogue scripts, or AI art farms

🧬 WHAT’S ACTUALLY HAPPENING
Qubits get initialized into a uniform superposition.

You measure them = collapse into a real bitstring.

That 32-bit result → split into segments → int seeds.

Those numbers decide everything — shape count, color, positions, transparency, etc.

Styles vary: chaotic geometry, recursive fractals, symmetric inkblots.

Every piece = a non-reversible act of quantum decision.

}
The .json sidecar is your proof of cosmic origin.

🛸 WHY THIS ISN’T JUST “COOL”
Most generators fake randomness.
This one lets the universe make the first move.

You’re not choosing shapes.
You’re choosing to ask nature a question.
And when it answers, you paint with its uncertainty.

🔮 FUTURE IDEAS (OR GLITCHES IN REALITY)
