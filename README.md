# 🧠🌀 QUANTUM ART GENERATOR

This isn’t art made by humans.  
This isn’t art made by machines.  
This is **art made by the void** — the raw entropy of the quantum realm — harnessed, digitized, and rendered as pixels by a handcrafted code engine that’s part aesthetic ritual, part physics experiment, part unhinged cosmic joke.

## ⚛️ TL;DR

- Real quantum seed (via Qiskit & AerSimulator)  
- Falls back to `random.getrandbits()` if your timeline sucks  
- PyQt5 GUI with threaded generation (no freezing, no tears)  
- 3 styles: `original`, `fractal`, `inkblot`  
- CLI mode for when you want to batch-hack the matrix  
- Full metadata dump in `.json` — reproducible entropy included
